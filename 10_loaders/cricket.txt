Cricket is the second most popular sport in the world, with over 2.5 billion fans in 180 countries.
It originated as a children's game in 16th century England.
The first recorded cricket match was played in Kent in 1646.
The longest cricket match ever played lasted for 14 days in 1939 between England and South Africa, and still ended in a draw.
The term "wicket" has multiple meanings in cricket: it can refer to the collection of three stumps and two bails, or the dismissal of a batsman.
The original wickets had only two stumps, but this was changed to three in 1775 after a bowler managed to bowl three consecutive balls between the stumps without dislodging the single bail.
Matches can be played without bails in strong wind or poor visibility conditions.
A batsman can be given out without facing a ball, for example, if they are run out at the non-striker's end or declared "timed out".
A "century" is when a batsman scores 100 runs, a significant achievement in the sport.
The number 111 is considered unlucky in cricket and is called a "Nelson".
